## Resubmission 
I am re-submitting, after incorporation comments by Swetlana Herbrandt and Uwe Ligges. Specifically:

* I updated the date field. 
* I replaced the 'snow' package with 'parallel' in the Suggests description. 
* I updated the title and description, which now provide more detail on what the package does (generally and specifically). I have also included a reference to the paper our paper implements. 
* I added examples in all primary functions users will call. 

## Test Environments 
* local ubuntu 16.04, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
