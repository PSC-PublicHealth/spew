## Run the new version on Olympus for all 50 states!

## Improve make.R
- Add in a module which selects the variables 
- Add in checks which verifies the two PUMS have the same serial numbers (currently assuming this is true) 
- Add an input which specifies the ID variable used for sampling 
- Add dependencies to plyr and sp packages 
- Add unit tests, finish documentation 
- Contingency if there's two polygons for a particular region. Right now I'm only selecting the first

## Write spew.R function which integrates read, format, and make functions. 
- Include an output directory 

## Write unit tests for format.R 

## Write up Version Control for guidelines 
  - Use Hadley's git/github tutorial 

## Document each new function
	- Start with the Read functions... 
	- Include a section in the documentation 
  
## Finish Unit Tests for read.R
  - Following the example of 

## Implement IPUMS read.R functions 
	- Use an example country (canada, africa, etc...)
