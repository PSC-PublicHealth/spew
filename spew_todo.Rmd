## Run the new version on Olympus for all 50 states!

## Improve make.R
- Add in a module which selects the variables 
- Add in checks which verifies the two PUMS have the same serial numbers (currently assuming this is true) 
- Add an input which specifies the ID variable used for sampling 
- Add dependencies to plyr and sp packages 
- Add unit tests, finish documentation 
- Contingency if there's two polygons for a particular region. NEED TO FIX!


## Write spew.R function which integrates read, format, and make functions. 
- Include an output directory 
- Include an option for Variables to Keep!!


## Unit tests
- Finish read.R 
- format.R 
- make.R


## Implement IPUMS functions 
- format.R
- read.R


## Write up Version Control for guidelines 
- Use Hadley's git/github tutorial 


## Document each new function
- Read functions 
- Format Functions 


## Implement IPUMS format.R functions extensions
- Note that the core of format.R should work with the ipums files, 
  it's simple for the USA since we only need to add a column to the poptable. 

## Add in a clickable feature to donwload the synthetic ecosystems 
- Shiny "Map" is a refinement
- Needs to be clickable!

## Add in a feature which can include mosquitoes
