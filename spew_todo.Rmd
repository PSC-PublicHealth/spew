## Write spew.R function which integrates read, format, and make functions. 
- Include an output directory 
- Include an option for selecting variables... 

## Run the new version on Olympus for all 50 states!
- Write spew.R 
- Install spew on Olympus
- Read about parallelizing code, automate this step given the 
number of cores
- Set up a bash script which can call spew for each state

## Improve make.R
- Write a separate function which outputs microdata for an individual place 
- Add in checks which verifies the two PUMS have the same serial numbers (currently assuming this is true)
- Add an input which specifies the ID variable used for linking the individual 
and household PUMS (maybe add this to spew.R?)
- For now, if there are multiple polygons to sample, I am just sampling from 
the first one for convinience. In the future, we may want to think of something 
more elegant here (such as a union)

## Unit tests
- read.R (finish testing individual functions, test the entire function as well)
- format.R 
- make.R

## Write up Versi on Control for guidelines 
- Use Hadley's git/github tutorial 

## Implement IPUMS functions 
- format.R
- read.R


## Document each new function
- Read functions 
- Format Functions 

## Implement IPUMS format.R functions extensions
- Note that the core of format.R should work with the ipums files, 
  it's simple for the USA since we only need to add a column to the poptable. 

## Add in a clickable feature to donwload the synthetic ecosystems 
- Shiny "Map" is a refinement
- Needs to be clickable!

## Add in a feature which can include mosquitoes
- Use the vector map data!!!
