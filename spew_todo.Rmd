## Generate the Western Hemisphere 
  Strategy:
  
  1. Add country to lookup table
  2. Run SPEW for this country, and check the logfile. 
  3. If this doesn't work, run in interactive mode to identify the problem 
  4. Make the fixes to the problem in a prep.R file located in the same input 
  directory (see Canada for example)
  5. Once fixed, run, verify it works, then move to the $ONLINE directory 


## Canadian PUMS
  - Write up the documentation 
  
## Improve functions  
- read.R
  - For now, if there are multiple polygons to sample, I am just sampling from 
the first one for convinience. In the future, we may want to think of something 
more elegant here (such as a union)

- format.R 
  
- make.R 
  - Make sure join(people) doesn't include duplicated columns
  - Make sure join(people) doesn't include duplicate rows.... (with the new serial!)
  - Account for the household weights 

## Schools/Workplaces
- Need to add in the schools + workplaces modules for the United States  

## Add in a diagnostics function

- Go into a synthetic population directory and create summary statistics and plots which display the output in an
easily human interpretable manner. Used as a sanity check

- Maps and summary statistics 

- The function should be able to go into a directory with many CSV's and print out whatever diagnostics are needed. 
We may also want to consider appending all of the files together for easier use 


## Add in a clickable feature to donwload the synthetic ecosystems 
- Shiny "Map" is a refinement
- Needs to be clickable!

## Add in a feature which can include mosquitoes
- Use the vector map data!!!

## Write up Version Control for guidelines 
- Use Hadley's git/github tutorial
