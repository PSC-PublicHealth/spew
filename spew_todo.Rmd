## Write spew.R function which integrates read, format, and make functions. 
- Add in a variable which specifies the va
- Add an input which specifies the ID variable used for linking the individual 
and household PUMS (maybe add this to spew.R?)


## Run the new version on Olympus for all 50 states!
- Write spew.R 
- Install spew on Olympus
- Set up a bash script which can call spew for each state

## Improve make.R
- Add in checks which verifies the two PUMS have the same serial numbers (currently assuming this is true)
- For now, if there are multiple polygons to sample, I am just sampling from 
the first one for convinience. In the future, we may want to think of something 
more elegant here (such as a union)

## Improve read.R
- Update read.R so that it can now read and standardize miscellaneous data sources. For me, the three groups should be "US", "ipums", and "none". Where in "none", you can specify the filepaths for each one of the data sources. More inpute will be needed to the "none" group, however, since we will need to know which row is the place_id, puma_id, etc...

## Unit tests
- read.R (finish testing individual functions, test the entire function as well)
- format.R 
- make.R

## Write up Versi on Control for guidelines 
- Use Hadley's git/github tutorial 

## Implement IPUMS functions 
- format.R
- read.R

## Document each new function
- Read functions 
- Format Functions 

## Implement IPUMS format.R functions extensions
- Note that the core of format.R should work with the ipums files, 
  it's simple for the USA since we only need to add a column to the poptable. 

## Add in a clickable feature to donwload the synthetic ecosystems 
- Shiny "Map" is a refinement
- Needs to be clickable!

## Add in a feature which can include mosquitoes
- Use the vector map data!!!
